 Some dissertations are carefully written monographs, evolving through years of careful scholarship.
 This is not that kind of dissertation.
 This dissertation is a piece of industrial equipment forged hot in the crucible of necessity.
 It began the moment I failed at scholarship and got a job.

 The \textit{sina non qua} figure in the production of this dissertation is the inimitable Dr. Michael Carl Tschantz.
 To him I owe a lifelong gratitude for getting me hired by Dr. Helen Nissenbaum as a researcher on DARPA agreement number FA8750-16-2-0287.
 This act snatched me from the jaws of failure and delivered me to New York City, my home, where I could work towards completion with renewed vigor.
 Helen is a firm taskmaster in addition to a visionary thinker.
 Her intellectual ambition gave me the permission I needed to express my own.

 Chapter \ref{chapter:CI-through-CS} of this dissertation is, truth be told, the brainchild of Helen Nissenbaum and the brilliant Dr. Seda {\"u}rses.
 It is with their permission that I include our collaborative work here.
 Seda's kind instruction in the nuanced art and science of privacy engineering was essential for my education in this field.
 Through this work I've learned that what truly matters in scholarship is not ones individual powers but rather ones complementarity with collaborators of high caliber.

 Chapter \ref{chapter:origin-privacy} was originally written as a technical report in collaboration with Dr. Michael Tschantz and Dr. Anupam Datta.

 Anupam--senior, brilliant, detached--opened my eyes to a field of active and practical research at the intersection of law and computer science that I had thought was merely an imagined future. His words were spare but his influence was great.
 I wish I could call him my teacher, but having never been his student but rather more weakly and bureaucratically attached, I can call him an inspiration.

 Where Anupam led me by example, Michael led me through hands-on mentorship.
 Michael is a man who has, to use the Platonic metaphor, left the cave, seen the world in sunlight, and returned to the cave to teach. 
 I am deeply grateful for his insistence on mathematical rigor and his clear articulation of the weaknesses of my arguments, again and again.
 He has challenged me to reach for the level of precision and rigor that I can be proud of.

 Chapter \ref{chapter:games-and-rules} is most dear to me, as it contains what I feel is this dissertation's most original contribution: a framework for modeling the consequences of information flow in strategic games.
 For this, I am deeply grateful to Dr. David Wolpert, who introduced me to Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams by email as a way of correcting my omission of them from a preprint of a related paper I had published to arXiv.
