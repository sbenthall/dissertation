 Contextual Integrity: appropriate information flow. We have surveyed it, published its open questions, and in so doing have opened it from a theory and into a field. This body of work belongs to the growing field of contextual integrity.

 The definition of information flow used is intended to be a first shot at a new scientific theory of semantic information. This is a deep field, out of scope of the dissertation. Floridi survey article. What this theory has going for it is that it, like Shannon information theory, is based on foundational mathematics (Pearl's) that has broad and interdisciplinary applicability. While it may not be the consensus view of formal modeling of causality, it is one of very few contenders for the title.

 As this theory depends on probabilistic causation, it encounters the same problem that every probabilistic theory encounters, which is the question of frequentist and subjectivism. I have deliberately left this out of scope.

 The meaning of information depending on the process that creates it, the way that process is situated in a causal system, and the strategichoices of actors within that system.

Information is \textit{interpreted} based on the observer's beliefs about the causal structure that generates it. Sloman. This explains why norms and spheres are important: ``spheres'' may be sustained as mental models of the causal relations in which information flows, giving it its meaning. A testable, empirical hypothesis.

 
Information flows are not the transfers of goods. They are actions that change the strategic landscape. Information is not a good; it is a strategic asset. (Compare with capital, for Bourdieu, which is that theoretical substance that fields are organized around).

Applications to privacy engineering, law, etc. But also finance. Also prediction of the course of AI (which depends on data flows). Are there any equilibrium conditions?
