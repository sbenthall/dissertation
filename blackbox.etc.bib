@comment{This not a normal bibtex file.}
@comment{optional to do: venue -> series}
@comment{another concern: basically all style files treat in the case of a inproceedings address as the location of a conference despite the bibtex standard and databases treating it as the address of the publisher.  Thus, I need better style files.}
@comment{publisher is replaced with rpublisher in the case that the publisher is clear from the title.  I've done this by hand.}
@comment{dnote is used for notes on when webpages are accessed.}
